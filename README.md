# Encrypted-Database-using-RAM
“Encrypted Database using RAM” is a CLI (Command Line Interface) app which is used to store and manage the Data into the main memory of the system which helps to access the data quickly which is in trivial system takes too much time because of the use of secondary memory to store the data. Also the data gets compressed and encrypted before getting stored into the memory with the help of Huffman Coding Algorithm which makes our database more Secured and the data takes less space than the normal one because of the compression. Thus, our project improves the access speed (10^6 times), security and the storage used by the data.
